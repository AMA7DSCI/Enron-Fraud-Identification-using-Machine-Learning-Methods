List and Description of Files:

"Enron Fraud Identifier Project Discussion" - This pdf file contains the basic overview for the project and should be read before running the remainder of the files below. This file can also be used as a refererence when running the code files.

"Naive Bayes Combinations Tried" - This html document contains information on the feature combinations tried and their performance.

 See the "Enron Fraud Identifier Project Discussion" file for more background.

"poi_id.py" - This python script is essentially the identifier which identifies persons of interest in the Enron fraud case. See details in the "Enron Fraud Identifier Project Discussion" file for background on this project. This file contains the code that will generate the classifier, feature list, and cleaned data .pkl files (These are also included in the folder however - see below). The folder this file is in has all the dependencies needed to run this file. 



"my_classifier.pkl" - This is a file generated by running the "poi_id.py" file and contains the classifier created. 



"my_dataset.pkl" - This is a file generated by running the "poi_id.py" file and contains the cleaned data set.



"my_feature_list.pkl" - This is a file generated by running the "poi_id.py" file and contains the list of features used in the identifier.  



"feature_format.py" - This file contains code to run the "poi_id.py" file noted above.



"final_project_dataset.pkl" - This file contains the data which will be needed to run the "poi_id.py" file -- Essentially contains the Udacity provided financial and email data set for this project.



"tester.py" - This file contains code needed to run the "poi_id.py" file noted above and also is needed for my validation mechanism using Udacity code.  A function in this file can also be run independently to validate the identifier in "poi_id.py".



*Some baseline code in each of the code files was provided by Udacity. This repository is based on work completed for a Udacity project. The main portions of "poi_id.py" and the methods used to finalize the Naive Bayes algorithm and the features used were generated by me.
